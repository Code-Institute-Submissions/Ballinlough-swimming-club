- Responsive Membership Fee Table:
To complete the responsive membership fee table in the membersip section I used some code from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_pricing_table.asp).
- Collapsible Navigation Bar:
To allow the website to be more visible for mobile and tablet users, a Bootstrap navigation bar was introduced. The inspiration for this came from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_navbar.asp)
