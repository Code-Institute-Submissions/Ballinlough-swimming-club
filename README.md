### UX (User Experience)
<br/> Project Goals:
-   The aim of this project is to create an informative website for a fictional swimming club, "Ballinlough Swimming Club".
-   I am passionate about swimming so this project is an expression of my interest in this pasttime.

<br/> User Goals:
-   Find information about the Ballinlough Swimming Club.
-   Find contact details for the club.
-   Use the contact form provided to message the club.
-   Find information about the club's activities.
-   Locate the club's membership fee structure.

<br/> User Stories:
-   As a user, I wish to find information on the club's activities so that I may join if interested.
-   As a user, I would like to locate membership fee information as I will be better abled to make a decision on whether to join the club.
-   As a user, I want to find out about classes so that I may be better informed and attend if I wish.
-   As a user, I wish to be able to contact the club so that I may join.

<br/> Site Owner Goals:
-   As a site owner, I want to inform users about the club's activities to heighten their interest in the club.
-   As a site owner, I wish to inform users about the club's membership fee structure so that they are informed of the cost if they wish to join.
-   As a site owner, I wish to inform users about the club's management team to allow members to contact specific team members if they wish.
-   As a site owner, I want to create a means through which users can contact the club.

<br/> User Requirements:
-   Navigate the site efficiently using the navigation bar.
-   Provide information in an organised method that easily allows users to find what they require.
-   Contact form operates properly and validates data inputed.

<br/> User Expectations:
-   Content answers users' questions in a concise manner.
-   Have a visually appealling layout.
-   All navigation links work as expected.

<br/> Site Layout & Design:
1. Wireframes
Initially the site's layout was drawn out using a pencil and graph paper. Following on from this, a more defined version was created using Balsamic wireframes. Three sets of wireframes were created for the following media devices:

*  Mobile Devices
*  Tablet Devices
*  Desktop/ Large Devices

Based on the initial designs, I decided that a single scrolling web page would be better at engaging the user and heightening their interest in the Ballinlough Swimming Club.

2. Icons
Icons were used to convey links to the following social media platforms: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Youtube. These were chosen as they are appropriate for the club's image. Font-Awesome icons were used. LinkedIn was not included as it was deemed not appropriate for the aims of increasing the club's membership.

3. Images
I decided that stock photos would be used to improve the aesthetics of the site. For the hero image I chose a photo of lane swimmers to indicate to the user that this was a professional swimming club that entered competitions. For the team members photos I used stock photos of business people to show the management team's professionalism.

Only one external link was included in the website. This was a link to the annual Lee Swim; an actual swimming competition. The relevant button was tested to determine if a new tab opened and showed the desired website.

- Responsive Membership Fee Table:
To complete the responsive membership fee table in the membersip section I used some code from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_pricing_table.asp).
- Collapsible Navigation Bar:
To allow the website to be more visible for mobile and tablet users, a Bootstrap navigation bar was introduced. The inspiration for this came from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_navbar.asp)
